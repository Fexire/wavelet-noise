\section{Abstract}



\section{Introduction}

Noise function is used to generate synthetic textures with natural randomness. It can be used to generate visual elements or even for procedural textures. In 2002 Ken Perlin noise was the best noise function, despite the fractal noise and simplex noise have take on Ken Perlin noise nowadays, we will study the Ken Perlin problems. The main problems are that 3D noise projected on 2D surface such as screen can lead to aliasing and detail loss.
